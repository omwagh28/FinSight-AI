# FinSight AI – Agentic Financial Intelligence Platform

FinSight AI is an AI-powered financial intelligence platform that helps investors, analysts, and researchers understand complex financial documents through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), financial risk analysis, scorecard generation, and company comparison workflows.

The platform transforms lengthy annual reports, earnings filings, investor presentations, and financial statements into actionable insights, risk assessments, financial health scores, and conversational answers.

## Problem Statement

Financial reports often contain hundreds of pages of dense information, making it difficult for investors and analysts to quickly identify financial strengths, risks, growth opportunities, and operational concerns.

Traditional manual analysis is:

* Time consuming
* Error prone
* Difficult to scale across multiple companies
* Challenging for retail investors

FinSight AI addresses this challenge by automatically extracting, retrieving, analyzing, and explaining financial information using AI-powered document intelligence.
